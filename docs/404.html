			*** STOP: 0x000003AB (0xFA420D6E,0x000C4E69,0x00000000,0x00000000)<br>
			INACCESSIBLE_WEBSITE_THINGY_MA_BOBER<br>
			<br>
			If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, good job.<br>
			You're probably good at typing URLs. Or you're really new to the internet and still haven't gotten a 404 before.<br>
			If this screen appears again, then either the website is exploding or your URL typing skills are a dumpster fire.<br>
			<br>
			Check for viruses on your computer. Oh wait, this is a flippin' browser 404. Why on Earth would there be viruses on your computer?<br>
			(btw there might actually be viruses on your PC you should check)<br>
			<br>
			Remove any newly installed yada yada blah blah blah incoherent tech babble about exploding your hard drive to fix your PC no one cares.<br>
			Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, except if your hard drive is broken, then you wouldn't have a browser and wouldn't be reading this message since this message isn't a real BSOD.<br>
			<br>
			Refer to your No One Cares Microsoft manual for more information on troubleshooting Stop errors even though there's no Stop error.<br>
			To reiterate, it's a literal 404. It's <i>not</i> a goddamn Stop error.<br>
			<br>
			Not sure why I wrote this sarcastic piece of idiocy for my 404 page but anyways...<br>
