			If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, good job.<br>
			You're probably good at typing URLs. Or you're really new to the internet.<br>
			If this screen appears again, then either the website is exploding or you're URL typing skills are a dumpster fire.<br>
			<br>
			Check for viruses on your computer. Oh wait, this is a frickin' browser 404. Why on Earth would there be viruses on your computer?<br>
			(btw there might actually be viruses on your PC you should check)<br>
			<br>
			Remove any newly installed yada yada blah blah blah tech psychobabble about exploding your hard drive to fix your PC no one cares.<br>
			Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, except if your hard drive is broken, then you wouldn't have a browser and wouldn't be reading this message since this message isn't a real BSOD.<br>
			<br>
			Refer to your No One Cares Microsoft Windows 2000 manual for more information on troubleshooting Stop errors even though there's no Stop error<br>
