				If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, good job.
				You're probably good at typing URLs. Or you're really new to the internet.
				If this screen appears again, then either the website is exploding or you're URL typing skills are a dumpster fire.
				
				Check for viruses on your computer. Oh wait, this is a frickin' browser 404. Why on Earth would there be viruses on your computer?
				(btw there might actually be viruses on your PC you should check)
				
				Remove any newly installed yada yada blah blah blah tech psychobabble about exploding your hard drive to fix your PC no one cares.
				Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, except if your hard drive is broken, then you wouldn't have a browser and wouldn't be reading this message since this message isn't a real BSOD.
				
				Refer to your No One Cares Microsoft Windows 2000 manual for more information on troubleshooting Stop errors even though there's no Stop error
