			<h1>About me or something like that.</h1>
			<p>When I was born, I was kidnapped by an evil man named James Gilright.</p>
			<p>He captured me, hoping to use my powers as his, but I said <code class="code">james.stupid = True; self.escape()</code> and got away from him.</p>
			<p>After that event, I lived in the wild, fighting off dangerous monsters such as the legendary XNA, and surviving on my own in the beastly wilds.</p>
			<p>One day, I felt a strange trembling in the ground. The Earth split at my feet, and in front of me, the mythical Microsoft rose from the fiery crevasse. I had thought those were extinct for millions of years!</p>
			<p>It grabbed me, kicking and screaming, back to it's lair, and set me down.</p>
			<p>I tried <code>.kill()</code>, I tried <code>self.teleport(*pos.random)</code>, I tried every piece of code known to man, but it must've destroyed Python with it's ancient magic and replaced it with C#, which I didn't know.</p>
			<p>The horrible creature tried to force me to use VS Code, but my will to live was too strong.</p>
			<p>In desperation, I attempted C# code to try and escape. <code>namespace Escape {class escape {static void Main(string[] args) {this.teleport(pos.random);}}}</code> seemed to work.</p>
			<p>As I disappeared, I heard it roar in frustration. It hadn't expected me to figure out how to use the archaic language.</p>
			<p>I spent the rest of my life, traveling through the wilds of CompSciLand, dodging beasts and James Gilright.</p>
